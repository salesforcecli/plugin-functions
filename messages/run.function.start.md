# summary

Build and run a Salesforce Function.

# description

Run this command from the directory of your Salesforce Functions project.

This command will run the target function in a container. In the future, this command will run the target function on the host operating system (locally) instead. If one mode is preferred over the other, consider using the `container` or `local` subcommand instead.
