# summary

Build and run a Salesforce Function.

# description

Run this command from the directory of your Salesforce Functions project.

This command will run the target function locally (on the same operating system as this CLI), just like the `local` subcommand.

Previously, this command ran functions in a container. Container mode is still supported via the `container` subcommand. Arguments relevant to container mode are still accepted, but are deprecated, ignored, and will be dropped in a future release.
